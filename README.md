### Incresize

# What is it?
Basically it increases the size of your .exe file according to size you want.

# But why?
Because the aim is making the exe file not uploadable for virustotal.com.

# How does it works?
It appends unnecessary data to exe so the exe size get bigger. You can choose different modes. Which are:

1. Lorem ipsum mode: it creates lorem ipsum and appends to the .exe.
2. Binary mode: it creates 0 and 1, and it appends to the .exe.
3. Custom mode: you can choose the text you want to add to the .exe.
